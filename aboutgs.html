                        Sir William Gilbert (1836-1911) and Sir Arthur Sullivan 
                        (1842-1900) are perhaps the best known librettist and 
                        opera composer of Victorian England.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sullivan, whose father was a musician and army 
                        bandmaster, studied music from the earliest age and 
                        became successful as a composer in a variety of 
                        classical styles. Gilbert went through a traditional 
                        English education and toyed with law jobs, but soon 
                        moved into comedy, and after a series of burlesque 
                        plays shifted towards more refined plays.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan was
                        in 1871 for the play Thespis. Later, in 1875, Richard 
                        D’Oyly Carte, impresario at London’s Royal Theatre, 
                        brought the two men together again to complete Trial 
                        by Jury, their first real success. Over the next twenty 
                        years, the two created twelve more light operas, 
                        including the most famous Pirates of Penzance (1879), 
                        H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), The Mikado (1885), and 
                        Iolanthe (1882). The shows were transferred to D’Oyly 
                        Carte’s Savoy Theater in 1881, which has become known 
                        ever since as the home of Gilbert and Sullivan works.

                    <p>
                        The shows are in general comedic satires on British 
                        society, often criticizing the nobility with dry musical
                        wit (Iolanthe spends the whole show making fun of the 
                        House of Peers), or comparing British society to others 
                        (as in The Mikado, which is set in Japan). With one 
                        (and perhaps two) exception(s), no one dies in G+S shows
                        and love always triumphs in the end – often with the 
                        help of some legalistic loophole found.

                        Both men were knighted (Sullivan in 1883, Gilbert in 
                        1907), and both created numerous works on their own and 
                        with other collaborators, before, during, and after 
                        their partnership.
